# rEFInd Minimalistic Theme

[rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) is an easy to use boot manager for UEFI
based systems. This is a clean and minimal theme for it.

>NOTE: This theme is forked and modified version of [refind-theme](https://github.com/kvnbias/refind-theme) by [kvnbias](https://github.com/kvnbias)
>>The original theme was  a combination of [rEFInd-minimal](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/rEFInd-minimal) and [refind-dreary](https://github.com/dheishman/refind-dreary).

## Installation

Fork this repository to you local directory by running the following command in terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iammrmehedi/rEFInd-Minimalistic-Theme.git
```

## Usage

 1. Locate your refind EFI directory. This is commonly `/boot/EFI/refind`
    though it will depend on where you mount your ESP and where rEFInd is
    installed. `fdisk -l` and `mount` may help.

 2. Create a folder called `themes` inside it, if it doesn't already exist

 3. Clone this repository into the `themes` directory.

 4. To enable the theme add `include themes/rEFInd-Minimalistic-Theme/theme.conf` at the end of
    `refind.conf`.

Here's an example menuentry configuration (from the screenshot)

```text
menuentry "Windows 11 Pro" {
 icon \EFI\refind\themes\rEFInd-Minimalistic-Theme\icons\os_win11.png
     loader \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi
}
menuentry "Debian" {
    icon /EFI/refind/themes/rEFInd-Minimalistic-Theme/icons/os_debian.png
    volume 53f60ca1-c118-4885-b66b-3f29039e5a43
    loader /boot/vmlinuz-6.1.0-9-amd64
    initrd /boot/initrd.img-6.1.0-9-amd64
    options "root=UUID=60ebb4c2-e9e3-4ba4-a0a8-f662d51d8b4d ro quiet nomodeset mitigations=off "
}
```

Entries that are autodetected should also show the proper icons.

## Background sizes

If you find the background looks blurry it may be due to the included wallpaper
being an incorrect resolution for your monitor. You can download the [original
high quality wallpaper][wallpaper], resize it as appropriate, and replace the
`background.png`.

You can of course also choose your own background!
